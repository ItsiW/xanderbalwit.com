        <p>
          I'm Xander Balwit, the editor-in-chief at <a href="https://press.asimov.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asimov Press</a>, a digital magazine dedicated to biotechnology, metascience, and scientific progress. Together with co-founder Niko McCarty, we publish lucid writing that explores the ways biology and biotechnology can be used to do good — from long-form investigations to speculative fiction imagining plausible futures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Asimov Press is an editorially-independent part of <a href="https://www.asimov.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asimov</a>, a biotechnology company. Since launching in late 2023, we've published over 100,000 words about biotech and scientific progress, printed two books (including <em>Origins</em> and our DNA-encoded second book), and built a team of six.

        <h3 class="font-serif text-2xl text-charcoal! mt-10!">Background</h3>

        <p>
          My path to science publishing has been anything but linear. I graduated from Portland State University in 2022 with a 4.0 GPA. Before that, I spent a summer as a wildland firefighter with the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde in Oregon, managed a Colorado State House campaign, worked as a wedding florist, and served as a publicity assistant and research assistant.
        </p>

        <p>
          I speak German and English, and I'm based in San Francisco, California.

        <p>
          My writing and editorial work spans a wide range of topics, united by a fascination with how biology and technology reshape the world:

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">

          <li><strong class="text-charcoal">Metascience</strong> — the systematic study of science itself and how to accelerate progress</li>
          <li><strong class="text-charcoal">Food systems</strong> — GMOs, cellular agriculture, and the future of what we eat</li>
          <li><strong class="text-charcoal">Neuroscience</strong> — connectomics, brain mapping, and the frontiers of understanding the mind</li>
          <li><strong class="text-charcoal">Speculative fiction</strong> — imagining plausible, positive futures rooted in real science</li>
