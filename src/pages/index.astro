        I work on the editorial team at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthropic</a>. Previously, I was the editor-in-chief of <a href="https://press.asimov.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asimov Press</a>, a publication dedicated to biotechnology, metascience, and scientific progress. For two years, I managed our editorial pipeline, working closely with our authors to develop essays that were rigorous, beautiful, and thorough. My own writing explores themes from animal welfare and longevity to food systems and neuroscience.

      <p class="mt-4 text-charcoal-light text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Before building Asimov Press, I worked as a wildland firefighter, managed a political campaign, and studied German fairytales.
