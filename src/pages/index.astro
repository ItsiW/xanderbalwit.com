      <p class="mt-6 text-charcoal-light text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I'm the editor-in-chief of <a href="https://press.asimov.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asimov Press</a>, a digital magazine dedicated to biotechnology, metascience, and scientific progress. My writing explores the technologies and ideas that enable flourishing — from animal welfare and longevity to food systems and neuroscience.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-charcoal-light text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Before building Asimov Press, I worked as a wildland firefighter, managed a political campaign, and studied at Portland State University. I'm unremittingly interested in humanity's future — the plausible, the dismal, and the hopeful.
